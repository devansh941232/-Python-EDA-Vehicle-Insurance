## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing over **381,000 records** of vehicle insurance data. By conducting detailed EDA, I explored customer demographics, premium distributions, claim patterns, and regional trends. The goal was to derive valuable insights into customer behavior and claims, enabling data-driven decision-making for the insurance sector.

## 🔑 Key Points

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** :
  - Addressed outliers in annual premiums using IQR and statistical methods.
  - Standardized data types and ensured no missing values.

- **Customer Demographics** :
  - Age: Majority of policyholders are in their 20s and 30s.
  - Gender: Balanced distribution between male and female policyholders.

- **Premium Distribution** :
  - Most customers pay moderate to low premiums, with a few high outliers.
  - Significant differences in premiums based on vehicle damage and age.

- **Claims Analysis** :
  - High claim frequency for older vehicles and previously uninsured customers.
  - Certain regions exhibited disproportionately high claim activity.

## ❓ Questions Answered

- How does vehicle age impact claim frequency?
- Which regions have the highest claim activity?
- Are premiums influenced by vehicle damage and age?
- How do demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) relate to claim behavior?
- What are the key indicators of claim likelihood?

These insights help refine insurance strategies, optimize premiums, and improve risk management.
